# custom_feed_forward_ann_tensorflow
Constructs a tensorflow graph that represents custom architecture feed-forward artificial neural network for classification task. Define number of layers and number of nodes in each layer by hidden_shape tuple argument in main_graph function. Moreover betanum argument defines L2 regularization parameter. The main_graph function utilizes efficient tf.data API of tensorflow.
